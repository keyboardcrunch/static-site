            <!-- should show a blurb from the post as preview -->
            <p>Just a synopsis of what my point-in-time setup Home Assistant looks like. Includes the Zigbee hardware I chose, some capabilities I've added in and how I may use them.</p>

            <p>Kicking the tires on FleetDM, for fun and security.</p>

            <!-- should show a blurb from the post as preview -->
            <p>I've been lacking specific motivation to throw into a singular project (re: there's so much I want to do or study), but recently some boredom browsing has lead me to stumble upon some blogs that have given me inspiration for what I'd like to see from my own work. This post covers what inspired me and what I put together.</p>
        
            </li><li><a href="/posts/hacking_better_sentinelone/">2022-03-26 - Hacking a Better SentinelOne</a>
            <!-- should show a blurb from the post as preview -->
            <p>SentinelOne has since added USB scan capabilities, but this was my whack at building an endpoint service that would detect Device Control events and initiate a USB drive scan using the installed agent.</p>
        
            </li><li><a href="/posts/Recommended-SentinelOne-Custom-Detections/">2021-04-15 - Recommended SentinelOne Custom Detections</a>
            <!-- should show a blurb from the post as preview -->
            <p>Some dated Deep Visibility 1.0 queries I like to highlight for detection capabilities. SentinelOne has grown so much since this post was written.</p>
        
            </li><li><a href="/posts/SCCM_Baseline_For_SentinelOne/">2021-03-31 - SCCM Baselines for SentinelOne</a>
            <!-- should show a blurb from the post as preview -->
            <p>Just some SCCM/MEMCM configuration items and baselines I put together to detect misconfigured or firewalled SentinelOne agents in the fleet. The SentinelOne agents have gotten much better at maintaining console communications to report errors, but I find that a second check from a more reliable agent is nice to have too.</p>
