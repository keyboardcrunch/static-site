While this isn't a post about Mastodon I found a ton of inspiration seeing so many creative folks doing interesting things.</p><p>Simon Willison... I love the format of his <a href="https://github.com/simonw/">GitHub readme</a>, the live updates of Github activity, blog posts, and TIL's, and the TILs!!! I'd been thinking about using ActivityPub/Plermo/Mastodon to essentially micro-blog short bits of things I learned to track them like notes on a public scale but <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til">TIL</a> is awesome! My approach I decided to take a bit differently, at least until I can figure out how I want to post my TIL items. I have a <a href="https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori">Shiori</a> bookmark server (which has a very very limited and goofy API that only returns 30 items, no pagination, no filters) so it's like a "what I'm reading" feed. So with some Python and Flask, ripping a free HTML5 template off the interwebz, and putting together a single page site that lists GitHub activity, Blog Posts, and Bookmarks/Recently Read. I wanted this to be hosted on DigitalOcean as a web function but it needs clean-up and performance tweaks before I can get there, but it's working and running on <a href="https://keyboardcrunch.com/">keyboardcrunch.com</a>.</p><p><video controls="controls" preload="auto" src="./site_preview.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p><div class="footer">Made by keyboardcrunch | <a href="https://github.com/keyboardcrunch/static-site/">source code </a></div></div></div></div></body></html>
