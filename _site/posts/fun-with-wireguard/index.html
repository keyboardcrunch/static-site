Though recently a number of toolsets/frameworks tailored for networking of containers or "bolt on zero-trust" networking have expanded that perception. My goal with this post is to highlight some software leveraging Wireguard, and to list a few different use-cases and reasons for using Wireguard (over traditional VPN or ZeroTier).</p><h2>Use Cases</h2><ul><li>Meshed networking of disparate peers.</li><li>Exposing internal network applications to the internet without port forwarding.</li><li>Exposing web apps with a reverse proxy to Wireguard network clients.</li><li>Point-to-point VPN for connected sites.</li><li>Non-forwarded Wireguard connection for LAN gaming and resource sharing.</li><li>Resilient VPN for mobile devices, capable of handling network hopping.</li></ul><h2>Software Leveraging Wireguard</h2><h3>Innernet</h3><p><a href="https://blog.tonari.no/introducing-innernet">innernet</a> is an opensource alternative to Tailscale or ZeroTier that can create a secure networks with minimal management overhead.</p><h3>Tailscale</h3><p><a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> is a zero config VPN with firewall rule management, allowing for a secure network layer on top of existing infrastructure.</p><h3>Firezone</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/firezone/firezone">Firezone</a> is a Linux package to manage your WireGuard VPN and Linux firewall from a simple web interface.</p><h3>PiVPN</h3><p><a href="https://www.pivpn.io/">PiVPN</a> is an absolutely simple deployment and management script for Wireguard, well suited for a Raspberry Pi and other light weight deployments, with its simplicity taking after that of the <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a> project.</p><h3>Algo by Trail of Bits</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/algo">Algo</a> is a set if Ansible deployment scripts for building a personal Wireguard (or IPsec) VPN with support for many common cloud providers.</p><h2>Personal Uses</h2><p>My most recent uses of Wireguard is with a non-forwarded client setup, creating a loose mesh network for devices on different LANs to communicate; and in some cases using a Nginx reverse proxy on the Wireguard VPN server to expose internal web applications to the internet.</p><p>Aside from a standard VPN or the above mesh, I've found that Wireguard works exceptionally on my phone. I can switch between cellular and WiFi without any noticed drops. And with mobile carriers getting heavy handed with "anonymized" data collection, ads, and apps heavy with telemetry; having an always on Wireguard VPN with Pi-Hole serving up DNS for the clients, I can audit and block access to unwanted resources.</p><div class="footer">Made by keyboardcrunch | <a href="https://github.com/keyboardcrunch/static-site/">source code </a></div></div></div></div></body></html>
