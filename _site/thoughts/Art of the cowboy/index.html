<h1>Developers vs Cowboys, the arts of putting things on the internet.</h1>
<p>Being that my day job, hobbies, and interests are all intersecting with security... I read a lot of "news" about security related events and "hackers". Something I'm frequently reading and shaking my head at is the old narrative of</p>
<pre><code class="language-text hljs language-plaintext">"Hackers are exploiting $X thousand $SOFTWARE servers that developers unknowingly exposed to the internet without security controls."
</code></pre>
<p>And without directly calling out specific posts or the existence of Redis servers facing the public internet, I'd like to introduce my definition of these <em>administrators</em> and <em>developers</em>. I call them <strong>cowboys</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text hljs language-plaintext">Cowboy'ing (verb)
The act of taking on or working a project, and executing on it without taking the steps of understanding the components or their implications.

Example: Brian cloned an app off Github for a company project and cowboy'd some shit together, including an internet facing Redis server.

Synonym: Yolo'ing
</code></pre>
<p>I just find it hard to believe that any self respecting developer would expose a server to the internet that had no visible authentication methods and required commenting out a line of a config file that included a warning immediately above it. But in general us folks of the IT and Information Security variety see on a daily basis the results of others "cowboy-ing" shit into existence, and we get the pressures and deadlines.</p>
<p>But RTFM.</p>
