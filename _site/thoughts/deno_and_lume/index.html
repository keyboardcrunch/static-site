Lume is pretty great.<p>I'm in the process of building out a new static site with Lume, which is easy once you grok the design choices, and porting over everything I wrote under my last Hugo blog. This is where I really like markdown based static sites, a bit of copy/paste and update a few links and you're all set. I don't even want to think about all the wordpress and ghost sites I have decommissioned over time, and how much history lost (though I have the backups, I'm too lazy to merge it from json exports).<div class=footer>Awful Design by @keyboardcrunch</div></div></div>
