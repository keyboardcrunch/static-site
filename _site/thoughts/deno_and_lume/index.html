Lume is pretty great too.</p><p>I'm in the process of building out a new static site with <strong>Lume</strong> (this site you're reading right now!), which is easy once you grok the design choices, and porting over everything I wrote under my last Hugo blog. This is where I really like markdown based static sites, a bit of copy/paste and update a few links and you're all set. I don't even want to think about all the wordpress and ghost sites I have decommissioned over time, and how much history lost (though I have the backups, I'm too lazy to merge it from json exports).</p><p><strong>Deno Deploy</strong> was exceedingly easy to get working, just as all the reviews and feedback said and easier than the docs led on. I was able move my code to GitHub, sign-in to Deno Deploy with my GitHub account, link the project and done!</p><p>I'm enjoying Deno enough that I decided to write out the "new post" util called <code>lumepost.ts</code> in Deno, and while I've got very little previous experience with JavaScript and TypeScript, I was able to write it out in about 50 minutes with a lot of learning in the process. The next thing I'm eyeing is Deno executed with Supabase functions.</p><div class="footer">Made by keyboardcrunch | <a href="https://github.com/keyboardcrunch/static-site/">source code </a></div></div></div></div></body></html>
