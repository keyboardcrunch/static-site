<p>This month has been a crazy one. The weather has been awful, I was temporarily displaced by hurricane Beryl (but it allowed me the opportunity to work out of the SpaceX facilities in Bastrop for a week), I bought a friend a bike and some gear, I purchased the early release of the Starlink Mini, had a few mental setbacks and recovered, lost more weight, and added gravel bike (Trek ALR4) to my collection. My daily routine has been all out of wack with work and cycling taking up much of my week day leading me to spend most of the weekend decompressing and relaxing; meaning I'm feeling unsatisfied with the lack of study and project time as if I'm in full cope mode. But things are still looking up, I'm healthy, and I still have motivation.</p>
<p>Now for some links I've come across, skimmed, and wish I had more time to read through and absorb.</p>

<p>Finally, after spending a number of weeks with my homelab down and realizing how little of it I use I've decided that when I have time I'll simplify the hosted services and methods for hosting it all, and change up routing and hostnames on my network. I just don't need or use most of what I'm hosting or setup and need to make it easier to maintain (same things goes for this site that seems to have broken routes suddenly after deno/lume updates), though I have competing interests in cycling more and doing more study on OS internals and reverse engineering.</p>
