    <div class="about-text">
        <p>
            I've been career focused on endpoint security since 2016, primarily the management of endpoint security tooling, 
            detection engineering, desktop software and SaaS reviews, and some "light" adversary emulation work. I enjoy the detection
            and threat hunting (defender) side of the job far more than the attacker side, probably because of all the odd application
            behaviors you discover along the way (without the effort of reverse engineering).
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been working at SpaceX since 2021, and previously I was a security engineer at Woodforest National Bank 
            (11 years!) and <i>the</i> system administrator for a small start-up building an anonymous file sharing and chat application.
