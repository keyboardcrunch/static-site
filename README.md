# About This Project

This is a personal blog and micro-blog, written in TypeScript/Deno using the Lume static site generator.

It's currently very ugly as I decided I didn't like the defaults of Tailwind CSS, didn't want to use WindiCSS
as it's deprecated, and I don't need the extras they come with. There's still a list of things todo to get this site
ready.

## TODO
* Add pagination to posts/ and thoughts/
* Create a helper util to create new post/thought pages
* Setup the Lume Feed plugin so all site posts aren't bundled together
* Complete the 'Good Reads' bookmarks aggregator for the home page
* Add a theme toggle for dark/light mode
